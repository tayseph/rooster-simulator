# Hawaiian Roaming Rooster Simulator Configuration

# Number of roosters in the simulation
num_roosters: 10

# Time parameters for state reevaluation
time_unit: 10.0  # Base time in seconds to reevaluate rooster states
time_randomization: 0.3  # Randomization factor (0.0 - 1.0) to make timing less predictable

# Simulation time settings
simulation_time:
  start_time: "06:00"  # Starting time of day for simulation (HH:MM format in 24hr)
  time_scale: 60.0  # Time acceleration factor (60.0 = 1 real minute = 1 simulated hour)

# Movement parameters
movement:
  frequency: 0.15  # Probability of movement per time unit (0.0 - 1.0)
  chance_to_move: 0.7  # Base chance that a rooster will move at all (0.0 - 1.0)
  distance_min: 2.0  # Minimum movement distance in meters
  distance_max: 10.0  # Maximum movement distance in meters

  # Curiosity/Roaming personality trait
  curiosity:
    min: 0.5  # Minimum curiosity value (0.0 = sedentary, 1.0 = very active)
    max: 1.5  # Maximum curiosity value (multiplies with chance_to_move)
    # Each rooster gets a random curiosity between min and max
    # Higher curiosity = more likely to move around
    # Lower curiosity = prefers staying in one area

# Calling parameters
calling:
  frequency: 0.2  # Base probability of calling per time unit (0.0 - 1.0)

  # Proximity response - roosters responding to nearby calls
  proximity_response:
    reply_likelihood: 0.6  # Chance to reply to a nearby rooster (0.0 - 1.0)
    trigger_distance: 30.0  # Distance in meters where response is triggered
    randomization: 0.4  # Randomization factor for reply behavior (0.0 - 1.0)

  # Time-of-day based calling frequency
  # Roosters crow 24/7, but likelihood varies by time of day
  time_of_day:
    enabled: true  # Enable time-of-day based calling frequency

    # Dawn settings - peak crowing time
    dawn_time: "06:00"  # Time of dawn (HH:MM format in 24hr)
    dawn_duration: 1.0  # Hours around dawn with peak activity
    dawn_multiplier: 5.0  # Multiplier for calling frequency at dawn (100% = always crow)

    # Daylight hours (after dawn until dusk)
    daylight_start: "07:00"  # When daylight period begins
    daylight_end: "18:00"  # When daylight period ends
    daylight_multiplier: 1.5  # Multiplier for calling frequency during day

    # Nighttime hours
    nighttime_multiplier: 0.3  # Multiplier for calling frequency at night (but they still crow!)

# Area of operations (radial area with listener at center)
area:
  max_radius: 500.0  # Distance to furthest point from origin in meters
  distance_steps: 20  # Number of discrete distance levels from origin to edge

# Call audio settings
calls:
  default_call: "rooster_call_1.wav"  # Default rooster call file
  variation_probability: 0.3  # Chance to use a different call (0.0 - 1.0)

  # Call "stickiness" - some roosters prefer specific calls
  stickiness:
    percentage_sticky_roosters: 0.4  # Percentage of roosters with stickiness (0.0 - 1.0)
    alternate_call_chance: 0.7  # Chance they pick non-default call (0.0 - 1.0)
    revert_to_default_chance: 0.1  # Chance they return to default (0.0 - 1.0)
    randomization: 0.25  # Randomization factor for stickiness (0.0 - 1.0)

# Audio output settings
audio:
  sample_rate: 44100
  channels: 6  # 5.1 surround: FL, FR, C, LFE, RL, RR

  # Volume attenuation based on distance
  volume:
    min_distance: 5.0  # Distance at which volume is maximum
    max_distance: 100.0  # Distance at which volume reaches minimum
    min_volume: 0.05  # Minimum volume level (0.0 - 1.0)
    max_volume: 1.0  # Maximum volume level (0.0 - 1.0)
